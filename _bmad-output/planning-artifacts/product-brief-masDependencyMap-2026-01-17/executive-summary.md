# Executive Summary

masDependencyMap is a migration intelligence tool designed to unlock feature velocity in large legacy .NET codebases. Unlike traditional code quality analyzers, it focuses on identifying *where* to safely extract components from complex monolithic systems. By combining aggressive framework noise filtering, cycle detection algorithms, and automated extraction difficulty scoring, masDependencyMap transforms overwhelming dependency graphs into actionable migration roadmaps. The tool enables architects to make data-driven decisions about modernization sequencing, supporting safe strangler-fig pattern execution while maintaining production system stability.

**Target Users:** Software architects and development teams managing large legacy .NET systems (20+ years old, multi-solution architectures) who need to modernize incrementally without breaking production.

**Core Value:** Restore feature delivery velocity by identifying optimal extraction candidates for service carving and modernization.
